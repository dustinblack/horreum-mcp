# Horreum MCP Server: Development and Testing Strategy

This document outlines a strategy for developing and testing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes Horreum capabilities as MCP tools and resources for AI clients.

### 1. Recommended Language and Standards

To align with the MCP ecosystem and integrate with Horreum via its HTTP APIs, the project will use the following stack:

- **Language**: TypeScript (Node.js 20 LTS)
- **MCP SDK**: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (server)
- **Package Manager**: `pnpm` (or `npm`)
- **Tooling**: ESLint, Prettier, tsup (bundling), ts-node (dev)
- **Licensing**: Apache 2.0

Note: We will still adhere to Horreum/Hyperfoil contribution expectations for licensing and general code quality, while choosing TypeScript for first-class MCP support.

### 2. Development Strategy

The development will follow an iterative, phased approach with a read-first priority: implement and stabilize read-oriented tools before write-capable tools.

**Phase 1: Core MCP Server and Read Tools**

1.  **Project Scaffolding**: Initialize a TypeScript project and MCP server using the official SDK.
2.  **MCP Manifest**: Define server metadata and register initial tools/resources.
3.  **Read Tools (Horreum API)**: Implement tools that fetch data from Horreum (optional token-based auth):
    - `list_tests`: List Horreum tests with pagination and filters.
    - `get_schema`: Retrieve a Horreum schema by name or ID.
    - `list_runs`: List runs for a test with pagination and time filters.
4.  **Config & Auth**: Use environment variables for `HORREUM_BASE_URL` and optional `HORREUM_TOKEN` (omit for anonymous access).
5.  **Horreum Client Generation**: Generate a TypeScript client from the Horreum OpenAPI spec (via `openapi-typescript-codegen`) and use it directly. Centralize auth/headers via the generated `OpenAPI` config; optional retries/backoff and rate limiting remain in scope.

**Phase 2: Write Tools and Uploads**

1.  **upload_run**: Upload a run/dataset into a target test, with validation.
2.  **create_test (optional)**: Create a new test with a given schema reference.
3.  **Idempotency & Safety**: Support dry-run mode and idempotency keys where applicable.
4.  **Error Scenarios**: Handle specific error cases (network timeouts: 30s, auth failures: clear messaging, Horreum unavailable: graceful degradation).

**Phase 3: Observability and Hardening**

1.  **Logging/Tracing**: Structured logs; optional OpenTelemetry.
2.  **Rate Limits/Backoff**: Handle Horreum API backoff and error propagation.
3.  **Caching (optional)**: In-memory cache for hot reads with TTL.

**Phase 4: HTTP Standalone Mode**

1.  **HTTP Transport**: Implement HTTP server mode using `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` from MCP SDK with Express.js.
2.  **Dual Mode Support**: Support both stdio (current) and HTTP modes via configuration.
3.  **External LLM Integration**: Add configurable LLM API client for external inference (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, etc.).
4.  **Session Management**: Implement HTTP session management with UUIDs and optional resumability.
5.  **HTTP Security**: CORS configuration, Bearer token authentication, DNS rebinding protection.
6.  **Deployment Options**: Enable containerized deployments and cloud hosting scenarios.

**Phase 5: Containerization & Multi-Architecture Support**

- Container image: UBI9 Node.js 20 multi-stage build, non-root user (uid 10001),
  minimal runtime with production deps only; default HTTP mode on port 3000.
- Health endpoints exposed by HTTP server: `/health` (liveness, no auth) and
  `/ready` (readiness, enforces bearer auth when configured).
- Multi-architecture builds (amd64, arm64) using Buildah/Podman with a manifest
  list and optional push to registry; expiration label supported.
- Reusable build script: `scripts/build_multiarch.sh`
  - Inputs: `IMAGE_REPO`, `REGISTRY_USERNAME`/`REGISTRY_PASSWORD` (or
    `QUAY_USERNAME`/`QUAY_PASSWORD`), optional `OCI_REVISION`.
  - Options: `--tag`, `--push`, `--push-main`, `--expires`, `--file`.
  - Applies label `${EXPIRES_LABEL}` (default `quay.expires-after`) and
    `org.opencontainers.image.revision`.
- Automated registry deployment (quay.io) via CI runner using Buildah, gated on
  changes to `Containerfile`, sources, and CI config.
- Security: add container vulnerability scanning (e.g., Trivy or osv-scanner),
  and image hardening tasks (rootless, minimal packages, labels).

**Phase 6: Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline**

- Multi-stage testing pipeline with parallel execution and performance regression testing
- Comprehensive security scanning (osv-scanner, SAST, license compliance)
- Performance optimizations (caching, job interruption, conditional workflows)
- Release automation (semantic versioning, NPM/container publishing)

**Phase 7: Architecture Refactoring & Modularity**

- Extract shared logic into reusable modules with plugin architecture
- Make observability features truly optional with dependency injection
- Centralized error handling with circuit breaker patterns
- Hierarchical configuration system with validation and hot-reload

**Phase 8: Alternative HTTP API Mode & External MCP Integration**

- REST API endpoints (`GET /api/v1/tests`, `POST /api/v1/tests/{id}/runs`, etc.)
- OpenAPI 3.0 specification with Pydantic-compatible responses
- API versioning strategy with rate limiting and backward compatibility
- Service-based HTTP endpoints for external MCP consumption (`POST /tools/tests.list`, etc.)
- Support for "Independent MCPs" topology for MCP-to-MCP communication

**Phase 9: Build System Enhancement**

- Multi-architecture builds with cross-compilation and bundle optimization
- Advanced dependency management with automated updates and vulnerability scanning
- Build performance optimization (incremental builds, parallel processes)

**Phase 10: Testing & Security Hardening**

- Enhanced testing framework (unit, integration, contract, performance testing)
- Runtime security monitoring with secrets management and audit logging
- Operational readiness (health checks, metrics, graceful shutdown)

**Phase 11: Data Analysis**

- `analyze_run_data` tool for server-side statistical analysis with testing

### 3. Testing Strategy

A multi-layered testing approach will be implemented, following the read-first priority by stabilizing read tools before write tools.

1.  **Smoke Tests (in-memory transport)**: Innovative lightweight smoke tests validate `ping`,
    `list_tests` (folder-aware), `get_schema`, `list_runs` (time filters), and
    `upload_run` without external dependencies; executed in CI. Smokes use generic
    fixtures (e.g., `example-test`, id `123`) and in-memory MCP transport with mocked
    HTTP responses - this approach is highly effective for MCP server validation.
2.  **Unit Tests (Vitest or Jest)**: Test tool handlers and core utilities with mocked HTTP clients.
3.  **Integration Tests**: Use `nock` or `msw` to simulate Horreum endpoints; verify schema and error handling.
4.  **End-to-End (E2E)**: Exercise the MCP server via an MCP client (e.g., `mcp-cli`) to validate tool registration and execution.
5.  **Continuous Integration (CI)**: GitHub Actions on Node 20: install, lint, build, comprehensive smoke tests, and type-check.

### 4. MCP Tool Design Details

1. Tool schema: Define JSON Schemas for each tool input/output.
2. Error model: Uniform object `{ code, message, details, correlationId }` returned on failures.
3. Pagination/filtering: Inputs support `limit`, `offset`, `sort`, and filters; default `limit=50`, max `1000`.
4. Idempotency: For write tools, support idempotency tokens; read tools remain side-effect free.
5. Validation: Validate inputs against JSON Schema and sanitize outputs.
6. Read-first: Implement and stabilize read tools before write tools.
7. Cancellation: Honor MCP cancellation signals by wiring request-scoped `AbortController` into all outbound HTTP calls; fail fast with clear cancellation errors.
8. Streaming and large results: For potentially large results, use pagination by default and document limits. Support partial responses with continuation tokens where applicable.
9. Resources: In addition to tools, expose core Horreum entities as MCP resources with stable URIs (e.g., `horreum://tests/{id}`, `horreum://schemas/{id}`, `horreum://tests/{id}/runs/{runId}`). Implement resource discovery via the MCP resources listing, and include minimal metadata plus links to the corresponding tools.

### 5. Data Model and Persistence

No database is required for the MCP server. Optional components:

1. Caching: In-memory LRU cache (TTL) for frequent read endpoints.
2. Config: Environment-based configuration with validation at startup.
3. HTTP Mode: Optional HTTP server transport with session management and external LLM integration.

### 6. MCP Server Protocol and Horreum Auth

1. MCP registration: Server advertises tools/resources to the MCP client via the MCP protocol handshake.
2. Tool discovery: Implement `tools/list` handler to expose available tools with their schemas dynamically.
3. Horreum auth: Optional bearer token authentication (env `HORREUM_TOKEN`); support anonymous access when token is not provided; never log secrets when present.
4. Auth-aware tools: Read tools work in both authenticated and anonymous modes; write tools require authentication and fail gracefully with clear error messages when token is missing.
5. API versioning: Support Horreum API version compatibility by including `Accept: application/json` headers and handling version-specific endpoints.
6. Backoff/jitter: Exponential backoff with jitter on Horreum HTTP errors (initial: 1s, max: 30s, jitter: Â±25%).
7. Rate limiting: Implement client-side rate limiting (default: 10 req/sec to Horreum) with configurable limits.
8. Idempotency: Write tools include idempotency tokens to avoid duplicates.
9. Authentication backends: Horreum commonly uses Keycloak/OIDC. Initial implementation supports static bearer token via `HORREUM_TOKEN`. Roadmap: optional interactive OIDC (device/PKCE) to obtain short-lived tokens; never persist secrets to disk.
10. Token refresh strategy: With static tokens no refresh occurs. When interactive OIDC is introduced, use standard refresh tokens in-memory only; redact secrets in logs.
11. Capability matrix:
    - Anonymous mode: `list_tests`, `get_schema`, `list_runs`.
    - Authenticated mode: all read tools plus `upload_run` and optional `create_test`.
    - Behavior differences should be clearly documented in tool descriptions and errors when auth is required.

### 7. Security and Safety

1. Least privilege: Use scoped Horreum tokens when provided; support anonymous read access; enforce request rate limits.
2. Secrets: Use secure env; never log secrets; redact known patterns; gracefully handle missing auth for read operations.
3. Auth validation: Validate token format at startup if provided; fail fast on malformed tokens.
4. Audit: Log tool invocations and Horreum interactions with correlation IDs; include auth mode (authenticated/anonymous) in logs.

### 8. Observability

1. Metrics: Basic counters/timers around tool execution and Horreum calls.
2. Tracing: Optional OpenTelemetry spans; propagate `correlationId`.
3. Logging: Structured JSON logs with event types and correlation IDs.
4. Health: Startup self-check for configuration and Horreum connectivity (optional).

### 8.1. Production Readiness & Operational Concerns

1. **Resource Consistency**: All MCP resources (tests, schemas, runs) must implement uniform error handling with correlation IDs, structured logging, metrics recording, and tracing spans.
2. **Security Hardening**: Implement token redaction in all error messages and logs; validate tokens at startup with secure error handling; never expose sensitive data in debug output.
3. **Health Monitoring**: Provide startup connectivity validation to Horreum; implement optional health check endpoint for operational monitoring.
4. **Error Boundaries**: Ensure all resource URI validation returns structured error objects rather than generic text responses.
5. **Dependency Security**: Continuous monitoring of dependencies for vulnerabilities; automated security scanning in CI pipeline.

### 9. CI/CD

**Current (Phase 1-4)**: Node 20, ESLint/Prettier, Vitest with coverage, smoke
tests, basic security scanning (`npm audit`, secretlint), path-based change
detection.

Container build (Phase 5 specifics):

- Use a Buildah container job to invoke `scripts/build_multiarch.sh` with
  `IMAGE_REPO` and registry credentials from secrets, tagging `:main` on
  successful builds.
- Trigger on `main` branch when these paths change: `Containerfile`,
  `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `src/**/*`, `.github/workflows/*`.
- Example invocation (CI job script):
  ```bash
  export IMAGE_REPO=quay.io/<org>/horreum-mcp
  export QUAY_USERNAME="${{ secrets.QUAY_USERNAME }}"
  export QUAY_PASSWORD="${{ secrets.QUAY_PASSWORD }}"
  bash scripts/build_multiarch.sh --tag "${GIT_SHORT_SHA}" --push --push-main
  ```

**Enhanced (Phase 6)**: Multi-stage testing, comprehensive security scanning
(osv-scanner, SAST, container scanning via Trivy job), performance optimizations
(caching, job interruption), release automation (semantic versioning, NPM/
container publishing), quality gates, deployment pipeline with rollback.

**Requirements**: SemVer for packages/containers, automated CHANGELOG.md maintenance, API documentation generation.

### 10. Deployment and Configuration

The deployment strategy supports multiple deployment modes and environments, from simple CLI usage to enterprise container orchestration.

#### Runtime Requirements

1. **Runtime**: Node 20 LTS with ES modules support
2. **Architecture Support**: Multi-architecture builds (amd64, arm64)
3. **Container Support**: Podman/Docker with multi-stage builds

#### Packaging Options

1. **NPM Package**: Traditional Node.js package for CLI and programmatic usage
2. **Container Images**:
   - Multi-architecture container images (amd64/arm64)
   - Minimal base images (Alpine/distroless) with non-root user
   - Optimized layer caching and build context filtering
   - Vulnerability scanning and security hardening
3. **Standalone Binaries**: Optional single-file executables for specific platforms

#### Deployment Modes

- **CLI Mode**: Direct Node.js execution for development and scripting
- **Container Mode**: Multi-architecture containerized deployment
- **HTTP Server Mode**: Persistent HTTP server for web API access
- **Kubernetes**: Helm charts and manifests for orchestrated deployment
- **Serverless**: Optional serverless function deployment

_Configuration details provided in Quickstart section below._

Note: A minimal Quickstart with an example `.env` is provided below.

### 11. Success Criteria and Non-Goals

1. Success (Phase 1â3):
   - Read tools provide consistent results with pagination and filtering in both authenticated and anonymous modes.
   - E2E: MCP client can list tests, fetch schemas, list runs in anonymous mode; and upload runs in authenticated mode (Phase 2).
   - Resilience to transient Horreum/network failures with retries/backoff.
   - Clear error messaging when authentication is required but not provided.
2. Non-goals (initial):
   - Multi-tenant authz/ACLs beyond token scoping.
   - Long-term persistence or complex scheduling.
   - Arbitrary file transfer beyond Horreum-compatible payloads.

   - 2025-09-19 â Implemented rate-limited fetch with retries/backoff; exposed MCP
     resources for tests, schemas, and runs; updated README with tools/resources.
   - 2025-09-19 â Implemented read tools (`list_tests`, `get_schema`, `list_runs`) using generated OpenAPI client; added `upload_run` with smoke test; CI runs all smokes.
   - 2025-09-19 â Completed scaffolding, env validation, ESLint/Prettier, CI, and npm scripts.
   - 2025-09-19 â Authorized Phase 1 implementation and marked scaffolding as in progress.
   - 2025-09-19 â Added OpenAPI client generation wrapper, MCP resource exposure, cancellation/streaming behavior, CI optional live smoke test, SemVer and schema deprecation policy, and Quickstart with `.env` example.
   - 2025-09-19 â Added support for optional authentication: read tools work in anonymous mode, write tools require auth, updated configuration to make HORREUM_TOKEN optional, enhanced error handling and logging for auth modes.
   - 2025-09-19 â Enhanced plan with specific technical details: API versioning support, tool discovery implementation, concrete rate limiting values (10 req/sec), error handling timeouts (30s), and expanded configuration variables.
   - 2025-09-19 â Establish MCP server plan; set TypeScript/Node 20 and MCP SDK; define phases with read-first tool approach; update CI/testing accordingly.
   - 2025-09-19 â Added maintenance instructions, status checklist, and changelog; emphasized read-first priority; expanded sections.

### 13. Quickstart

1. Prerequisites
   - Node.js 20 LTS
   - `pnpm` (or `npm`)

2. Configure environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
HORREUM_BASE_URL=https://horreum.example.com
# HORREUM_TOKEN= # optional; uncomment when using authenticated tools
HORREUM_RATE_LIMIT=10
HORREUM_TIMEOUT=30000
HORREUM_API_VERSION=latest

# Optional: HTTP standalone mode (Phase 4)
# HTTP_MODE_ENABLED=true
# HTTP_PORT=3000
# LLM_PROVIDER=openai
# LLM_API_KEY=your-api-key
# LLM_MODEL=gpt-4
```

3. Install and run (development)
   - Install dependencies: `npm ci`
   - Build: `npm run build`
   - Start the server: `npm start`

4. Exercise with an MCP client
   - **Stdio mode (default)**: Use your preferred MCP client (e.g., `mcp-cli`) to connect to the server.
   - **HTTP mode (Phase 4)**: Set `HTTP_MODE_ENABLED=true` and access via HTTP at `http://localhost:3000/mcp`.
   - Try read tools first: `list_tests`, `get_schema`, `list_runs`.
   - For write tools (e.g., `upload_run`), set `HORREUM_TOKEN`.
   - For LLM integration (Phase 4), configure `LLM_PROVIDER` and `LLM_API_KEY`.
